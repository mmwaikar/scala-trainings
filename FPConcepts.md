# Functional Programming (FP) Concepts

 - The basic building block of a program is a **function** (not a class, not a method).
 
 - A function is pure, if it does not have any side effects (writing to console, or writing to a log file are all 
 examples of side-effects).
 
 - If a pure function is called with the same inputs, N number of times, it must return the same output.
 
 - **HOF (Higher Order Functions)** - any function which takes a function as an input, or which returns a function, is 
 a higher order function.
