# Day 2 Exercises

### Pattern matching

 - Try pattern matching on:
 
   - String values
   - Int values
   - different types (String, Int etc.)
   - sequences
   - tuples
   - try using a guard clause
 
### Traits

 - Define a trait with an abstract field, a field with a value, an abstract method and a method with a default
 implementation
 
 
 ### Case classes
 
 - Define a case class Bike which accepts two parameters - make (as string) and model (as string)
 
 - Check out toString and value equality (using == on two instances of this case class with same values)
 
 ### Objects
 
  - Define an IntUtils object with a method isEven which determined if an Int is even or not
  
 ### Classes
 
  - Define a class Employee with a var field and a val field
  
  - Check out what happens when you call toString on any instance of this class
  
  - Check out reference equality (using == and equals method on two instances of this class with same values)
  
  - Define another class which extends this trait
  
  - Try to define companion object(s) for the above class and case class
